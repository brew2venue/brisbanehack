Bitcoin and Ethereum meetup member "Jeff" has a startup Brew2Venue(.com). The purpose of this meetup is to hack / build a supply chain around beer for independent breweries.

**What's in it for me?**

If you're looking to start coding and building Ethereum based products, you will get real world hands-on experience and perhaps help a Brisbane based startup on his way to success. So some warm and fuzzies. 

**Who will own the IP?**

The code will be committed to GitHub under the MIT licence. https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/

**What's in it for Jeff and his startup?**

In his words, this is about seeing what is possible with Blockchain and Ethereum beyond it's typical application in financial services. It's an opportunity for the independents in the beer industry to reflect on current challenges with the supply chain and how technology may improve efficiency.

So we are doing free work for Jeff? 

The short answer is yes. If this is something of concern, then perhaps this isn't the event for you. 

**Agenda:**

**Day 1** - Kick off at 6pm. Set up your laptop with the tools required to start developing. High level view of what we are building, basic Git commands.

**Day 2** - Arrive at 9am and start building.

Avanade Australia have sponsored beer and pizza, and some people in the industry to present to at the end of the day.  Microsoft will attend and provide some Azure credits to run some nodes in the cloud.
